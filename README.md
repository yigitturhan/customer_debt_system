# customer_debt_system
A system where you can track the debts of your customers.

It is written at C# with entity framework. This system is for tracking debts. 
It uses local database with two tables. One for the single entries and the other for the total debt.
It has turkish column names because I wrote it for someone I know.
It has add, update, delete, search by name and print features.
